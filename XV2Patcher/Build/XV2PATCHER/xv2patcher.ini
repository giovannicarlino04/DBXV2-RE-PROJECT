[LooseFiles]
# Note about logging: some files go through different functions than these ones, those aren't logged.
# Enables the log of all files that go through the CpkGetFileInfo function. 
# If debug is enabled, you may get messages from the game like "W2008082701:Specified file was not found in the binder.". These messages are normal.

[NewChara]
# Anything in this section is only read if "new_chara" in Patches is set to true!
# The value below must be either "auto" or a number.
# If auto, the program will try to autodetect it.
# The auto-detection works like this: if a loose file exists in data/ui/iggy/CHARASELE.iggy, it will try to autodetect it using a simple heuristic algorithm.
# If the file doesn't exist or the heuristic fails, it will assume 99 (default of game). The decision of algorithm is written in the log.
# If non-auto, it must match the AS3 variable CharacterMax in CharaSele.as in CHARASELE.iggy (if they don't match, you will end with a broken selection dialogue) 
CharacterMax = auto

[BattleTimer]
# Anything in this section is only read if "battle_timer" in Patches is set to true!
# The time here represents the number of seconds of the timer.
# This value is a fractional number (32 bits float). Any value of the IEEE 754 standard for single precision can be used here
# infinity is a valid value and it will make the timer dissapear
time = infinity
